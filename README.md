# Working Experience

## Uber Carshare Australia (formerly Car Next Door)
**Software Engineer**, Full-time, Remote, June 2021 - June 2024.

- Collaborated with the CTO, Engineering Managers, Product Managers, fellow Engineers, Product team members, and a UI/UX Designer to rebuild the Car Next Door app using the latest Flutter technology. Played a key role in the product development revamp for approximately 18 months, culminating in the app's rebranding to Uber Carshare.
- Led the development of the Otoplug IoT device connectivity project, enhancing the borrower experience by enabling seamless Bluetooth-based locking and unlocking of vehicles, even in offline conditions such as underground parking or carpark buildings. This eliminated the previous need for an internet connection to perform these actions via API calls.
- Directed security and performance inspections of the app, significantly reducing the risk of malicious usage of private and sensitive keys. Achieved a 98% improvement in app performance by mitigating jagged behavior caused by micro-tasks and heavy I/O operations.

## Pluto Technology
**Mobile App Engineer (Contract)**, Full-time, Remote, Aug 2020 - Feb 2021

Pluto is an early-stage Startups Company that mainly focuses on delivering Road Analysis reports to their clients. Pluto uses Machine-learning enabled mobile apps to act as data acquisition tools to collect, analyze, and estimate the image stream inside the mobile app.

- Enhanced App Development: Led the continuous development and refinement of an initial Proof of Concept (POC) app, transforming it into a fully functional and user-ready application, which was successfully released to users.

- Location Estimation: Implemented advanced location estimation algorithms, leveraging GPS data, timestamps, and camera initial calibration, to accurately determine the location of identified damaged roads. This innovation enhanced the quality of the inference results on the map.

- Efficient ML Inference: Streamlined the inference process of TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) models within the app. This involved optimizing the capturing and analysis of images on the phone, seamlessly matching them with estimated locations. These improvements significantly increased the quality and accuracy of the reports generated for the road assessment.

- CI/CD Implementation: Established a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, automating the deployment process. This automation not only accelerated app updates and releases but also ensured consistent quality throughout the development lifecycle.
